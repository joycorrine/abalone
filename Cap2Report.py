# Predicting the Age of Abalones

Abalone is a common name for any of a group of small to very large marine snails. 
    The age of an abalone can be determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of 
    rings through a microscope. The age can then be calculated in years by adding 1.5 to the number of rings on the shell.

Counting the rings of an abalone shell can be an incredibly tedious and time-consuming task, so 
    I am going to attempt to build a regression model that can accurately predict the rings (age) of 
    an abalone based on knowing the shells' physical features.

### Source

To build my model, I’ll be using a dataset on abalone shells from the University of California, Irvine:

### Building a Predictive Model

For this dataset, I built multiple models in order to identify the best performing one at predicting the age of an 
    abalone shell. I tested with multiple variate regression, ridge regression, random forest, gradient boost, 
    support vector regression, and K nearest neighbors.

I used RMSE (root mean squared error) to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of my models, 
    and ultimately, my multiple variate regression model performed the best with an RMSE of 2.06.

**While in the process of evaluating my multiple variate regression model, I made 
an important discovery.**

I compared my model’s worst and best predictions (in terms of absolute difference 
    between the predicted value and real value) and found that my model performed 
    well at predicting ages around 12.5 and below, but did not perform as well 
    predicting older abalones (20+ years old).

Below you can see the top three worst predicted values - abalone 628, 678, and 233. They are all older than 22.5 years old,
    and my model prediction was 11-14 years off for each one of them. You can also see the results for the younger abalones - abalone 462,
    2983, and 3043. My model perfectly predicted their ages. This implies my model becomes less reliable as I add in more older
    abalones into my dataset.

### Updating Random Forest Model
Instead of using a linear-based model, I attempted improve one of my non-linear based models
   because I knew my data was non-linear -- the abalones' height and weight peaked close to 12-15 
   year's old, but as they got older, their measurements (weights and height) decreased.
   I decided to focus on my random forest model. Using Scikit-Learn’s RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, I found the
   best parameters for my Random Forest model, but ultimately, the model still did not improve or outperform
   my multiple variate model.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, I would be confident using the multiple variate regression model for abalones 
aged 12.5+ or younger, but for older abalones, I would either:
- 1. Build a new model which takes into account the skewed performance on older abalones, or 
- 2. Stick to counting the shell rings under a microscope. :)
